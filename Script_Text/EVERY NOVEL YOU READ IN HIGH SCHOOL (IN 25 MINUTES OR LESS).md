EVERY NOVEL YOU READ IN HIGH SCHOOL (IN 25 MINUTES OR LESS)
by Ian McWethy

Scene One
(PRINCIPAL BURKE walks on stage.)
PRINCIPAL BURKE: All right. Everyone! Settle, settle down. I know we're all excited to get to your summer plans. Beach balling or jimmy jamming. Lounging around playing your play-boxes with friends. But before you get going, I have an announcement to make about your assigned summer reading.
(The audience boos, maybe throws a cup or two.)
Hey, hey, hey! Settle. Settle. I can be here all day! I don't get a three-month summer vacation this year, so see if I care. I still have to come into work so keep it up!
(They settle.)
Okay. As I was saying, every year you are all assigned summer reading, which is usually just a book or two. But last year since none of you, literally none of you did the assigned read-ing, I'm trying a different tactic. You see, Bellum High School had the worst test scores in English out of anyone in the state. And that means I don't get my yearly bonus, which sucks.
Because I was hoping to refinance my Honda. But no. Not this year. I guess I'll just keep on leasing! So thanks for that ya dum-dums.
(Beat. How do you respond to that?)
Anyway, the point is that you are all willfully stupid. And as a result, I've gone to desperate measures to ensure you have some basic understanding of the assigned summer reading, which will hopefully help your test scores. So, for the remainder of seventh period you will be treated with a performance by a theatre troupe I hired. They will, right now, perform a condensed version of all the books you will be assigned to read this summer. So please give a warm welcome, or at least don't be jerks and throw stuff at them, l'm looking at you Tompkins...uh...for... the Hoxin Theatre Troupe!
(PRINCIPAL BURKE walks off stage as VANESS, PAMONA, and HUBIE run on.)
VANESS: Hi everyone! We are the Hoxin Theatre Troupe! Thank you for having us.
PAMONA: Just a little background on us, the Hoxin Theatre Troupe was founded three years
ago with the hope of creating socially relevant theatre in our community.
HUBIE: Which was a great mission statement but then we had a hard time getting any work or grants or people to see our shows. So we've branched out, and now will do pretty much any show for anyone who's willing to pay us.
VANESS: Theatre is hard. Really hard, don't do it as a career. It is a sad and poor way to live.
PAMONA: Anyway, Principal Burke offered us three hundred dollars to write, produce and perform a series of short plays summarizing all the books you'll have to read this summer. We three are the writers and directors, and our acting troupe...


(A troupe of actors runs on stage and waves.)
PAMONA: Will perform them all. That's right, every book, whether you are in ninth or eleventh
grade will be performed for you now.
VANESS: Runner, Lord of the Flies, To Kill A Mockingbird...
HUBIE: The works or Shakespeare, Steinbeck, Ray Bradbury, eleven books in all that will be
performed for you now in twenty-five minutes or less!
PRINCIPAL BURKE: Why twenty-five minutes? Well Principal Burke wrote into our contract that if we were a minute longer than twenty-five minutes, he wouldn't pay us.
VANESS: Which we admit is a terrible deal, but we have no leverage. Another problem with
running a theatre company. You never have any leverage. Ever.
HUBIE: Uh, actually now it's more like twenty-four minutes. Principal Burke talked longer than
we planned.
VANESS: What are you kidding me?! It was tough enough to adapt all these books into three-min-
ute plays, now we have to—
HUBIE: Now twenty-three minutes.
VANESS: Uh! Fine! Here we go!
Scene Two: Lord of the Flies
HUBIE: Our first book adaptation is Lord of the Flies. It's basically like The Hunger Games, or Maze Runner, but with only dudes, no love triangles, and no clear morals. Also the writing is way better.
VANESS: Anyway, we now present to you our version of THE LORD OF THE FLIES! We open on a deserted island. A war has broken out and a plane full of school boys, ages eight to twelve, crashes near a deserted island!
(Lights change. Sound effects of a plane crashing is heard. PIGGIE and RALPH wander into their light.)
PIGGIE: What happened to everyone!? Where are we!?
RALPH: Our plane got shot down. But don't worry, you're with me, Ralph! I'm tall and attrac-
tive, so nothing bad ever happens to me!
PIGGIE: And I'm book smart and am slightly over weight. So, l'm sure nothing bad will happen
to me either.
RALPH: Mmm... yeah...oh look a conk shell! Maybe this will get everyone's attention.
(JACK walks on stage in a choir robe.)
JACK: Hey! I just heard your conk shell! Anyway, would anyone mind if I anointed myself the
leader?
RALPH: Um, I'm slightly taller and slightly more handsome than you are, so I think I'll be the
leader. But why don't you be the leader of the hunters?

JACK: Okay, I like hunting. Hopefully my animal instincts won't overtake me, causing me to
lose my sense of right and wrong.
RALPH: No, no, that won't happen. Hunting will just be your job. I trust you not to get carried
away.
(JACK runs off stage.)
RALPH: All right, what's next? Piggie, how's everyone else doing?
PIGGIE: Uh, well, we started building huts.
RALPH: That's good.
PIGGIE: But then everyone just wanted to play and swim and we didn't finish building them.
RALPH: That's not good.
PIGGIE: But then we built a fire to signal for ships.
RALPH: That's good.
PIGGIE: But then everyone got distracted and the fire burnt out and also a kid may have died in
the fire because we weren't paying attention.
RALPH: Okay, that's bad. That's really bad. Uh, boy. Yikes. Let's make sure no one else dies.
Um... anything else?
PIGGIE: Well I guess I'm a little worried about Jack.
(JACK runs on stage, shirtless, covered in war paint, holding a pig.)
JACK: Wooo!!!!! Hunting man! What a rush! When you kill your first pig, it's like its soul goes into your brain! Hey, I just heard a rumor that there's a monster in the jungle, wanna go and kill it?!
PIGGIE: Oh no! A monster I'm so scared! So is everyone!
RALPH: Everyone be calm. I'm sure there's no monster. But I'll go with Jack and check it out
just to put everyone at ease.
(They run off stage.)
JACK AND RALPH: (Off stage:) АААНННН!!!!
(They run back on.)
RALPH: Yep, there's a monster.
JACK: See! See! Ralph's a coward! He shouldn't be the leader because of how he screamed
when he saw the monster!
RALPH: You screamed, too!
JACK: Whatever! Look, all those who want to hunt and not be scaredy cats like Ralph, come
with me! Everyone else, stay with Ralph!
PIGGIE: Oh man...we're really splitting into two warring factions! Not good. Not good.
JACK: Also I need your glasses to start a fire in our campsite. Gimme gimme gimme.
PIGGIE: But I need my glasses—
JACK: No I said gimme!
(JACK stabs PIGGIE!)
PIGGIE: Oh...man! I thought we weren't going to kill anymore people!
(PIGGIE dies.)
RALPH: Oh no! Our self made society is crumbling all around me! What do I do! What do I do!
(RALPH runs off stage!)
JACK: Now that I'm in charge and since I'm a symbol of chaos and our basest of instincts, let's
set this whole island on FIlIREEEE!!!!
(Screams and hollers are heard from off stage.)
(The lights flash on and off [simulating fire]!)
(RALPH runs in place [simulating running]!)
RALPH: Oh God! So much chaos! Must run to the ocean! Must run for my life! Must run! Must...
BRITISH OFFICER: (Off stage:) Um, excuse me. What is this? What is going on here?
(A BRITISH OFFICER walks on stage. RALPH stops running. Lights stop being "firey," and return to normal.)
RALPH: Who... who are you?
BRITISH OFFICER: Why l'm a naval officer who noticed a huge fire coming from your island.
Now, tell me, what on earth have you boys been up to?
(JACK runs on stage, stops when he sees the Officer. He drops to his knees.)
JACK: You stupid Ralph I'm gonna kill y-(And then they both start crying.)
RALPH: Oh God I'm sorry! I've done so many terrible things!!!!
JACK: My innocence is lost by these tragic days on this island!!!!
RALPH: I really thought there was a monster on this island! That's insane in retrospect!
JACK AND RALPH: WAAAAHHHH!!!!!
(Lights out.)
PAMONA: The end!
VANESS: Guys that took five minutes! We really gotta tighten up our cues. There's no way we're
gonna get through ten more novels!
ACTOR 1: We're going as fast as we can! Honestly l'm not sure that last play even made sense
we cut so much—
VANESS: Enough excuses just go faster! (To the audience:) Anyway, for our next play we move
from the scary setting of a deserted island to the even scarier setting of...
HUBIE: Salem, Massachusetts.

Scene Three: Runner
PAMONA: So just a little background. I was given the assignment of adapting Runner into a three-minute play. And since the book is really boring and terribly written and since I'm a big musical theatre dork I turned it into a musical. I thought it would at least make it more interesting. Anyway, without further ado, we present, Runner, a musi- cal in the style of Disne— 
VANESS: No! Don't say it. It's just a generic, family-friendly musical in no way associated with a giant conglomerate that owns one-fourth of the media landscape. 
PAMONA: Right. Sorry. Anyway, enjoy! Runner: the….Family musical.
HUBIE: No one cares, Pamona. 
PAMONA: Well they should! It was really hard…


___________________________________________________________________________
PAMONA: And that's Runner
VANESS: That's not Runner! And Charlie certainly doesn't tap dance!
PAMONA: Whatever this version's better. Runner is terrible!
HUBIE: Whatever, let's just move on! That took...six minutes! Wow musicals take forever, don't
they.

Scene Four: To Kill a Mockingbird
VANESS: Fine. Our next book is To Kill A Mockingbird, Harper Lee's timeless classic about
family, growing up, and prejudice. It is truly an American original.
PAMONA: Also an original... the play you are about to see. This three-minute version is also the
only play that was adapted by Hubie.
HUBIE: Thing about me is that unlike these two nerds I truly hate reading. But they said I had to adapt at least one book, and this one seemed short. Anyway, I hope you appreciate the time and effort I put into this because it took me forever and gave me a headache. So...yeah.
VANESS: Right. Thanks for that... weird introduction. Anyway, we present to you now, To Kill A
Mockingbird... in three minutes. We open on Maycomb Alabama, 1933-ish.
(Lights change. SCOUT appears on stage.)
SCOUT: Hi my name is Scout! I'm a tomboy who spends most of my time running around the neighborhood with my brother Jem, and our neighbor Dill. My dad is Atticus Finch, and he likes to tell me folksy heart-warming lessons like this...
(Lights up on ATTICUS. SCOUT walks over and sits on his lap.)
ATTICUS: You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of
view, until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.
SCOUT: Or this.
ATTICUS: Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy. That's why it's a sin
to kill a mockingbird. Unless...
(ATTICUS makes SCOUT get off his lap. He suddenly seems very serious, glares angrily.)
ATTICUS: Unless you happen upon the rare but very dangerous Jade Mockingbird. A Jade Mockingbird is five times the size of a regular mockingbird, it kills for sport and drinks the blood of innocent babies. So if you see a Jade Mockingbird you shoot to kill. You hear me, Scout. You shoot it in its ugly face. Point blank.
SCOUT: But Poppa. A Jade Mockingbird can't be all that bad, can it?
ATTICUS: A Jade Mockingbird killed your momma, Scout! Right in front my eyes he swooped in, killed her and then laughed in my face like a harpy devil! That Jade Mockingbird is pure evil, Scout! Ya hear me! Pure evil!
Just then the JADE MOCKINGBIRD (a person in some sort bird costume) swoops into the scene.
JADE MOCKINGBIRD: And l'd do it again, Atticus. We mockingbirds love to hear the sound of
a grown man cry.
ATTICUS: Run along now, Scout. Your father and this Jade Mockingbird have some unfinished
business to attend to.
SCOUT: Should I get your gun, Poppa?
ATTICUS: No need, l'm gonna tear this abomination to shreds with my bare hands!
JADE MOCKINGBIRD: And I'm going to break every moral bone in your body! CAW! CAW!!!!
(ATTICUS and JADE MOCKINGBIRD charge each other when...)
(VANESS comes on stage and interrupts them.)
VANESS: No! Stop! Stop.... This is not To Kill A Mockingbird. Hubie!
HUBIE: What?
VANESS: What is this?
HUBIE: This is the scene where Atticus gets his revenge on the evil Jade Mockingbird. You know
like from the title. (Beat.) Okay I didn't read the book.
VANESS: Hubie! You had one job!
HUBIE: I tried! I got like thirty pages in but it was super long and my head hurt so I just watched
the movie instead
VANESS: The black and white movie with Gregory Peck? 'Cause that's actually a pretty good— HUBIE: No! Black and white. Gross, what am I, a racist cartoon? No, I watched some manga
version on YouTube called, "Mockingbird Fly! Fly! Kill! Kill! Power Time!"
VANESS: Hubie! We can't keep performing this! This has almost nothing to do with the book!
HUBIE: Aweee! Why? We already rehearsed it. Can't we just cut to the end. The end is really
awesome.
VANESS: Hubie—
HUBIE: Look we're wasting time just talking about it so let's cut to the end and move on, we only have like...eight minutes left to do the rest of the books. Come on let's just go to the end.
PAMONA: Fine. Whatever! I guess, then, we now present to you the finale of "Mockingbird Fly!
Fly! Kill! Kill! Power Time!" A version of To Kill A Mockingbird you should not use if you are given a test on it.
(Lights change back to "Mockingbird Kill! Kill!" The JADE MOCKINGBIRD is about ready to kill a worn and injured ATTICUS.)
JADE MOCKINGBIRD: You are weak Atticus! Once I strike this final blow, I will harness the power of your pure soul and use it to open up a portal to my home planet KRE-KRAW. And then no one will be safe from the Jade Mockingbirds!
ATTICUS: God damn you Jade Mockingbird! God damn you to hell!!!
JADE MOCKINGBIRD: Any last words?
ATTICUS: Yes. Just two. Knock knock.
JADE MOCKINGBIRD: Who's there?
ATTICUS: Boo?
JADE MOCKINGBIRD: Boo who?
ATTICUS: Why are you crying? Because Boo Radley is about to mess. You. Up.
(And just then BOO RADLEY comes flying in with a huge weapon |I dunno, an axe? Samurai sword?).)
(The lights flash! Manga sound effects are heard!)
(BOO strikes JADE MOCKINGBIRD! He slo-mo tumbles to the ground.)
(Lights back to normal.)
ATTICUS: Boo Radley. Just in the nick of time.
BOO: Anytime Atticus. Anytime.
ATTICUS: So what do you say you, me, Jem, and Scout go out for a bowl of Super Star Ice
Cream. The only ice cream with chocolate fun fun star bursts in every bite.
BOO: As long as you're buying old man!
ATTICUS and BOO laugh! A "Pokemon-like song" about a "mockingbirds" starts to play.
They freeze in mid-laugh.)
VANESS: Okay! That's enough! God, that was terrible, Hubie! You aren't allowed to adapt any-
more of these.
HUBIE: Wa-hoo! That means no more reading!
VANESS: Moving on!
Scene Five: Moby Dick
VANESS: Okay so this one we really had to compress which was not easy because Moby Dick is the longest book ever and we only have...three minutes to do the whole thing. But we tried. Anyway, here's Moby Dick!
(Lights change. ISHMAEL runs into the spotlight.)
ISHMAEL: Call me Ishmael.
(QUEEQUEG walks on stage.)
QUEEQUEG: Sorry are you talking to me? Do you want me to call you Ishmael?
ISHMAEL: Well it was more just a thing I was saying for no reason, but sure, you can call me
Ishmael. Hey, you wanna join a whaling boat in Nantucket?
QUEEQUEG: Oh, hell ya! Adventure on the high seas! Here we come!
(The lights change. Now ISHMAEL's on the Pequod.)
ISHMAEL: And so my voyage begins. On the deck of Pequod I look onto the horizon and—
(AHAB hobbles on stage and pushes ISHMAEL out of the light.)
AHAB: All right! Everyone shut up! Ahab's here now! The best character in the book! Great, so here's the deal. A sperm whale ate my leg, and now I want to kill him. Also I smuggled a bunch of bad ass whale hunters onto the ship! This is their leader, Fedellah. Fun fact about him: he can see into the future.
(FEDELLAH walks on stage.)
FEDELLAH: I sure can! I'm a prophet. For example, I see a hearse made of wood, floating in the
water.
AHAB: Okay, that's weird. See anything else? Like maybe... Ahab killing a whale? Yeah? Maybe?
FEDELLAH: Uh...sort of.
SHIPMATE: (Off stage:) Look everyone! Starboard side! A whale!
(An actor appears in a WHALE costume for just a T-shirt that says "WHALE" or "A WHALE BUT NOT MOBY DICK"].)
WHALE: WWHHHAAALLEEE!!!!
(AHAB throws a harpoon at him.)
AHAB: Damn it! Missed. I don't think that was him anyway. Too small. Let's go to the Indian
Ocean and see if Moby Dick's there!
(The lights change. A different "WHALE" runs by.)
WHALE: WHHHAAALLLEEE!!!
(AHAB throws the harpoon. Nails him!)
WHALE: Oh... darn it.
(He falls over.)
AHAB: Is it him? Is it him? (He looks at the WHALE.) Damn it! That's not him! Errggh!!! (Calling out to the audience:) Hey you! Yeah, that random ship passing by! Have you seen Moby Dick?!
CAPTAIN 1: (Off stage:) No! But we have this crazed Gypsy woman on our boat who's predicting doom for anyone who pursues Moby Dick. So maybe you should take that as a sign of caution and stop pursuing him.
AHAB: Ah, what does she know! Anyone else out there seen my whale?
CAPTAIN 2: (Off stage:) Hey! Over here! It's me, Captain of the Samuel Enderby! I tried to kill
that whale and he bit my arm off! I would leave him alone.
AHAB: Look, I get it! The consequences of pursuing Moby Dick have been foreshadowed to me like eight times now but...I really wanna kill him! Okay! So just tell me where he is!
ISHMAEL: Look there he is! And it only took one hundred and thirty-two chapters. Hey, speaking of which, we skipped over the chapters where I discuss, for no reason, the science of whales, the whaling industry, and the history of mastheads on boats! Would anyone like me to summarize those for you now?
EVERYONE: No!
ISHMAEL: Alright. I'll be over here if you need me.
(ISHMAEL walks off stage.)
(And then MOBY DICK walks on stage, strutting, dressed up like a professional wrestler.)
AHAB: Oh it is on! I'm gonna kill you for biting my leg off you piece of whale garbage!
MOBY DICK: Bring it on, hop-a-long. Moby's hungry for seconds!
(ISHMAEL walks across with a score card that says "DAY 1.")
ISHMAEL: Day 1! Fight!
(NOTE: the following "choreography" is just an idea. Feel free to make your wrestling/fight-ing moves as you and the cast see fit.)

(The sound of a bell is heard. MOBY DICK runs in and close-lines AHAB. MOBY then preens to the crowd.)
MOBY DICK/ Oh damn! I just destroyed your harpoon boat!
(Again, ISHMAEL walks across with a "DAY 2" scorecard.)
ISHMAEL: Day 2! Fight!
(AHAB stabs him with a harpoon.)
AHAB: Ah ha! Gotchya! How you like that harpoon in your back!
MOBY DICK: About as much as I like using your leg as a tooth pick! Boom!
(MOBY DICK body slams AHAB. ISHMAEL walks across with a "DAY 3" sign.)
ISHMAEL: Day 3! Fight!
AHAB: Damn you, whale!!!
MOBY DICK: AAAAHHH!!!!
They run at each other as...black out! We hear the sounds of crashing and drowning and whale noises!)
(Spotlight on ISHMAEL, who's now on a coffin.)
ISHMAEL: Wow, I don't know how or why, but it seems that I'm the only one that survived!
What am I even floating on...hey! It's Queequeg's coffin! Just like Fedellah's prophecy said!
Well if that isn't irony then I don't know what is!
VANESS: And scene! Done. Moby Dick in three minutes! Well I guess that was more like four.
Scene Six: And all the rest
VANESS: Which means we have only three minutes left! This is pointless, we have seven more
books left. Let's just pack it in.
PAMONA: Would you stop talking like that. Which ones do we have left?
VANESS: We have three Shakespeare plays, two John Steinbeck novels about the Great Depres-sion, and two books set in a future where almost everything they predicted sixty years ago
came true.
PAMONA: Well let's just make a ton of cuts! Each play now gets twenty seconds! Actors come
out here!
(The ACTING TROUPE runs on stage!)
PAMONA: I have some last minute cuts to go over with you! If we can do the rest of the plays in the next two and a half minutes we all get paid! Real... actual... income! So you ready to do this!?
EVERYONE: Yeah!
PAMONA: Alright, follow me!
(They run off stage.)
VANESS: All right, I guess we're gonna try to do this. We now present to you... seven books in
two and a half minutes!
(VANESS runs off stage.)
(HUBIE stands stage right, holding up a sign that has the title of the book they're performing.
Every time they finish he rings a bell.)

Romeo and Juliet
(JULIET runs on stage.)
JULIET: Romeo! Romeo! Where art thou Romeo!
ROMEO: I'm here. I love you so much but our parents hate each other.
JULIET: Oh! Well then let's kill ourselves! You with poison! Me with a knife!
JULIET pulls out a knife, ROMEO drinks poison. They die.)
Hamlet
(GERTRUDE, HAMLET, LAERTES, and anybody else you have on stage.)
GERTRUDE: Hamlet. Your father is dead so I'm going to marry his brother. Your Uncle Clau-
dius.
HAMLET: But didn't Claudius kill my dad!? Oh, l'm so full of angst! To be or not to be...yadda
yadda. Screw it I'm just going to kill someone. Hey Laertes!
(HAMLET stabs LAERTES. LAERTES stabs HAMLET.) LAERTES: Ah, that blade you stabbed me with had poison on it!
HAMLET: Ah! So did yours!
GERTRUDE: My drink had poison!
EVERYONE: Ah Poison... So much poison... Oh no l'm doomed!... So much death.
(EVERYONE dies.)
Julius Caesar
(CASSIUS and BRUTUS.)
CASSIUS: Hey, let's kill Julius Caesar. Emperor of Rome!
BRUTUS: Uh, I don't know if I want to.
CASSIUS: Brutus, just do it.
BRUTUS: Okay.
JULIUS CAESAR walks on stage. They kill him.)
JULIUS CAESAR: I'm Julius Caesar, nothing bad ever happens... ay!....Et tu, Brute?
(MARC ANTONY walks on stage.)
MARC ANTONY: Well, we're back from fighting in a war and...oh you jerks. You killed Caesar.
Now I'm gonna kill you!
CASSIUS: You know what? l'Il just kill myself.
BRUTUS: Me too.
(They kill themselves.)
Of Mice and Men
(GEORGE and LENNIE walk on stage.)
GEORGE: Look Lennie, it's the Great Depression and we have to find work. So don't accidentally
kill anyone because you're so slow-witted and squeeze things too hard.
LENNIE: Okay George, I won't.
(A WOMAN in a red dress walks by.)
WOMAN IN RED: Hi boys.
LENNIE: Oh, you have purty hair.
(LENNIE hugs her and she dies.)
GEORGE: Damn it Lennie! What did I just say? Man...okay, just go look at that lake over there.
LENNIE: This one?
(LENNIE turns to look at a lake. GEORGE shoots him.)
The Grapes of Wrath
(TOM JOAD walks on stage.)
TOM: Well, it's the Great Depression. And since there are no jobs in Oklahoma, l'm gonna pack
up my family and go to California. Come on family!
(TOM and his family "pile in" an implied car.)
TOM: (Signing a song:) Going across the country. This is really depressing. Everyone's out of
work. Dah dah dah.
(The lights change. A SHERIFF walks on stage.)
TOM: And we made it to California! Where's my job?
SHERIFF: There are no jobs here Okie! So you and your family are just going to have to keep on
starving and suffering for a hundred more pages.
TOM: Ah man!
Fahrenheit 451
(GUY is burning books. A different PERSON approaches him.)
PERSON: Hey Guy? What are you doing? Burning books?
GUY: Yep, I'm a fireman in the future. And in the future, firemen burn things, especially books!
PERSON: Oh right, that's ironic. Say, why is it again that we as a society burn books?
GUY: Because they're outlawed. No one reads books anymore, they're too caught up in technology like giant flat screen TVs and ear pieces that play portable radio. In fact, people are so distracted by technology they don't seem to care about war or when people die or that our government is monitoring us at all times!
PERSON: Really? When did Ray Bradbury write this?
GUY: 1953. He was pretty dead on. (Beat.) Well, I'm gonna go join a society of rebel intellectuals who memorize books in the hopes that this knowledge will be useful after society descends into chaos and war. Byyyeee.
1984
(WINSTON and O'BRIEN walk onstage.)
O'BRIEN: Hey Winston. Everything okay? You look troubled.
WINSTON: Oh, I was just thinking how I don't much like this futuristic totalitarian society we live in, where the government monitors everyone through our TVs and cameras and can illegally arrest and torture citizens with no probable cause or warrant.
O'BRIEN: Wow, really? When did George Orwell write this?
WINSTON: 1949. He was pretty dead on too.
O'BRIEN: Huh. Well, anyway, I actually work for the government so l'm gonna arrest you now
and torture you until you're brainwashed.
WINSTON: Okay! You lead the way big brother!
Scene Seven: Let's wrap it up people
PAMONA: And done! We did it! Three Shakespeare plays and four novels in two minutes! Ho
man.
(The ACTING TROUPE look exhausted. Panting, catching their breath.)
(PRINCIPAL BURKE walks back on stage.)
PRINCIPAL BURKE: (Mildly enthusiastic:) Okay. Okay. Well wasn't that something! I hope you
all can at least get a D plus. Ya dummies.
VANESS: Okay, well, thank you for having us and...I guess we'll invoice you for our fee.
PRINCIPAL BURKE: Well... according to my ticker this took you twenty-six minutes. Which was
not what we agreed upon.
PAMONA: But…..that's because you talked for so long at the beginning!
HUBIE: And even so! We just gave you eleven productions of eleven books in twenty-six min-
utes. That's still pretty amazing.
PRINCIPAL BURKE: Yeah but...a deal's a deal. You all willingly signed my unfair and prepos-
terous contract. So...byyyyeee.
Every Novel You Read in High School (in 25 Minutes or Less) by Ian McWethy
(HUBIE, PAMONA, and VANESS walk off stage, dejected. They ad lib, curse BURKE, their chosen profession, as they do.)
PRINCIPAL BURKE: Well that's it. I hope you learned a few things today. One: The plots of Runner, Lord of the Flies, et cetera. So that you can do better on state wide aptitude tests. And two: Don't go into theatre. My life isn't great, but at least I have a 401 K and bene-fits. Look at what I was able to make a troupe of actors do for no money at all. It's a sad sad life. All right, that's it. I'm done, have a good summer. I'm going to lock myself in my office and play Candy Crush. Вууууе.
(PRINCIPAL BURKE walks off stage. And that's it. I'm not even sure if the lights go out.)
End of Play.
